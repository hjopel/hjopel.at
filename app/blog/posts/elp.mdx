# Welcome to, well... my pitch?

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center sm:items-start gap-6">

    I'm Jan, a guy who enjoys turning messy ideas into things that actually work. I like building things that have real value, without getting too caught up in the complexity.

## Why Me? 

### I like to build stuff
At 18, after a few small projects, I built [**admissio.at**](https://admissio.at), a school admin system that’s used by some of Austria’s largest schools. I realized early on that I enjoy turning ideas into practical, working solutions.

At [**Captic**](https://captic.io), I helped migrate from outdated infrastructure to a scalable, cloud-native setup. The goal? Save money, make things work better. I like working on tech that actually makes a difference and thinking about how it fits into the bigger picture.

## Freelance Experience
I’ve worked with startups to help them go from “Can we even do this?” to “Hey, this is actually working!” Whether it's building 3D web tools or figuring out how to make things scale, I like solving problems that matter.

## Why I hope to get into this program

I’ve always loved tinkering with tech, whether it’s launching random side projects or building on new ideas with my friend each week. Some ideas stick, some don’t—but that’s what keeps me learning and curious. The **Entrepreneurial Leadership Program** feels like the perfect way to refine what I’m doing, connect with others who share this passion, and learn from people who’ve already been through it. It’s a chance to grow, learn, and bring more structure to what I love doing: turning ideas into action.
